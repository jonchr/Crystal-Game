# Crystal-Game
An addition game demonstrating jQuery. This app creates a static webpage containing the game. A live version can be found at: https://jonchr.github.io/Crystal-Game/

## Description

The objective of this game is to get your score to exactly match the goal score by pressing the four crystals. Each of the four crystals will increase your score by an integer. The integer for each crystal is initially unknown to the player, various between 1 and 12, and changes with each game. The goal score ranges from 19 to 120, and also changes with each game. You lose if you increase your score above the goal score. Upon win or loss, the page will give an alert, and prepare the next game.


### Development

This game was developed as part of the GW Coding Bootcamp and was completed within end of the second week. This project was built using HTML5, CSS3 with Bootstrap 3.3.7, and Javascript with jQuery.

The four images for the crystals are all pop-culture references.

	Top Right - From the title card of British game show, The Crystal Maze
	Bottom Left - The Infinity Gaunlet from Marvel Comics
	Bottom Right - The Water, Fire, and Thunder Evolution stones from Pokemon

The random score for each crystal is stored as that HTML object's point's data-attribute.
